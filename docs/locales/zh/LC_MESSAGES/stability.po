"The API of joserfc is currently a work in progress and may not be "
"considered fully stable. However, with each release, the API stability is"
" improving and getting closer to a stable state."

"Starting from **version 0.5.0**, the method names and their parameters "
"are expected to remain stable. This means that once you have updated your"
" code to use the methods provided by joserfc, you can rely on them "
"without the need for frequent changes."

"``joserfc`` is designed to support Python 3.8 and above. It is "
"recommended to use ``joserfc`` with Python versions 3.8 and higher to "
"ensure compatibility and take advantage of the latest language features "
"and improvements."

"To maintain a stable and reliable library, joserfc will not introduce new"
" RFC implementations until the 1.0.0 release. This approach ensures that "
"the existing functionality is thoroughly tested and the library reaches a"
" mature state before incorporating new specifications."

msgid ""
"When new RFC implementations are added after the 1.0.0 release, the minor"
" version of joserfc will be incremented. This versioning approach helps "
"to communicate the introduction of new features and RFC support to users,"
" while also indicating potential changes to the API and behavior."

"Please note that while efforts are made to maintain compatibility and "
"stability, it is always a good practice to thoroughly test and validate "
"your code when upgrading to a new version of joserfc to ensure a smooth "
"transition and avoid any potential compatibility issues."
