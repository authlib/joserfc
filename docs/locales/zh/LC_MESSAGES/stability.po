"The API of joserfc is currently a work in progress and may not be "
"considered fully stable. However, with each release, the API stability is"
" improving and getting closer to a stable state."

"``joserfc`` have released **1.0.0**, the method names and their "
"parameters in modules ``joserfc.jws``, ``joserfc.jwe``, ``joserfc.jwk`` "
"and ``joserfc.jwt`` are expected to remain stable. This means that once "
"you have updated your code to use the methods provided by joserfc, you "
"can rely on them without the need for frequent changes."

"``joserfc`` is designed to support Python 3.8 and above. It is "
"recommended to use ``joserfc`` with Python versions 3.8 and higher to "
"ensure compatibility and take advantage of the latest language features "
"and improvements."

"To maintain a stable and reliable library, joserfc will not introduce new"
" RFC implementations until the 1.0.0 release. This approach ensures that "
"the existing functionality is thoroughly tested and the library reaches a"
" mature state before incorporating new specifications."

#: ../../stability.rst:32
msgid ""
"When new RFC implementations are added after the 1.0.0 release, the minor"
" version of joserfc will be incremented. This versioning approach helps "
"to communicate the introduction of new features and RFC support to users,"
" while also indicating potential changes to the API and behavior."

"Please note that while efforts are made to maintain compatibility and "

"your code when upgrading to a new version of joserfc to ensure a smooth "
