"In scenarios where you need to decode a JWT received from Azure "

"dynamically from the ``iss`` (issuer) value contained within the JWT."

msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:107
msgid ""
"In ``joserfc``, a callable key is a powerful feature that allows you to "
"dynamically retrieve and use the appropriate JSON Web Key (JWK) for token"
" decoding. In the context of Azure tokens, you can implement a callable "
"key to fetch the JWKs from the JWK Set URI and select the correct key "
"based on the kid (Key ID) in the token's header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:137
msgid ""
"When using the callable key method in ``joserfc`` to decode the tokens, "
"it retrieves the key dynamically on each token decoding request. However,"
" you may encounter performance issues due to the repeated retrieval of "
"keys. In such cases, it's advisable to optimize the callable key by "
"implementing key set caching based on the issuer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:142
msgid "Let's enhance the callable key method to improve its efficiency."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:162
msgid ""
"In this enhanced callable key, an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is used"
" to store JWK Sets for different issuers. When decoding a token, the "
"callable key function first checks if the JWK Set for the specific issuer"
" is available in the cache. If it's not, it fetches the JWK Set for the "
"issuer, caches it, and then selects the appropriate JWK based on the kid."
" This caching mechanism significantly reduces the network requests for "
"JWK Sets and improves the efficiency of token decoding."

msgid "Manual Token Decoding"
msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:172
msgid ""
"If you prefer a more hands-on approach and want to decode the token step "
"by step, you can opt for a manual decoding process. This method allows "
"you to extract the token string and work with it directly. Since the "
"token is a JWT in JWS format, you can utilize the ``extract_compact`` "
"method from the JWS module to obtain the necessary information. The "
"result of this extraction is an object of type "
":class:`~joserfc.jws.CompactSignature`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../recipes/azure.rst:185
msgid ""
"Similar to the approach detailed in the \"Using a Callable Key\" section,"
" you can retrieve the key set based on the issuer (``iss``) claim. This "
"method allows you to access the necessary keys for token verification."
